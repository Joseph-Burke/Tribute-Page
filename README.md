# Danny DeVito Tribute Page

As part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certificate, I have built a small tribute page to a comedic idol of mine, Danny DeVito. I particularly love Danny's work in the role of Frank Reynolds on the television programme "It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia". Here's to you, Danny.

# Project Requirements

**freeCodeCamp required the following things for this project:**

1. An element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
2. An element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
3. A div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
4. An img element with a corresponding id="image", inside the img-div.
5. An element inside img-div with a corresponding id="img-caption" containing textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
6. An element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
7. An a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
8. An img element that responsively resizes, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
