        <p id="tribute-info">
            Danny DeVito was born on November 17, 1944 in New Jersey to Daniel Sr. and Julia. From his very first
            portrayal of Louie De Palma in Taxi onwards, his work both on and off the screen would come to light the lives of
            millions around the world.
            <br><br>
            His trademark wry smile and inimitable sense of humour are almost as distinctive as his appearance, something which has
            helped DeVito enjoy a long and varied career in the performing arts – both in front of, and behind the camera.
            <br><br>
            In fact, while many of our generation may well know DeVito from his frankly award-worthy work as Frank Reynolds in It’s
            Always Sunny In Philadelphia or Penguin in Batman Returns, he is as prolific in the production of films as he is in the
            creation of iconic characters.
            <br><br>
            DeVito has his own production company, Jersey Films, which is responsible for many classic films. Perhaps most notable
            is Pulp Fiction, widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.
